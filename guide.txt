## Using PostMan Application APIs
--API Testing and Development:
API Testing and Development:
Postman provides a user-friendly interface for sending HTTP requests to APIs, making it easy to test and develop APIs. It supports various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

--Request Building:
Users can create requests by specifying the HTTP method, URL, headers, request parameters, and body content. Postman supports different request formats, including JSON and form-data.

--Collections:
Postman allows users to organize and group related requests into collections. Collections are helpful for managing and executing multiple requests as part of a workflow or testing suite.

--Automated Testing:
Postman supports the creation of automated test scripts using JavaScript. Test scripts can be associated with requests to perform validations, making it a powerful tool for automated testing of APIs.

--Environment Variables:
Users can define environment variables in Postman, allowing them to parameterize requests and switch between different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) seamlessly.
